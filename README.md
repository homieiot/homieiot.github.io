# Website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/homieiot/convention-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/homieiot/convention-website)

This repository contains the website sources for the [Homie Website](https://homieiot.github.io)
including the online validator javascript tool.

The build is triggered by a change in any of the Homie specification respositories
and performed by GitHub Actions. The resulting webpage is uploaded to
https://github.com/homieiot/homieiot.github.io/tree/master and is served by GitHub.

The generator in use is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## How to build locally

Just call the `./build.sh` script within this repository. The built website
will be available in the `./public` directory.

The only dependency required by the `./build.sh` script is [Docker],
which is used to create a builder image with the actual dependencies
required to build the website (Git, Hugo, Python and the dependencies
for the `./grabrepos.py` script).

The builder image is then used to build the website.

[Docker]: https://www.docker.com

## Upload a manually generated webpage

The webpage lives within the "master" branch of https://github.com/homieiot/homieiot.github.io/tree/master.
The generated "site" directory need to be pushed to that branch.

```
cd site
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:homieiot/homieiot.github.io.git
git add .
git commit -m "Manually generated webpage"
git push origin -f HEAD:master
```

## Data: FAQ, Maintainers

You find data files in the `data/` directory. At the moment this is the FAQs
and the maintainers file in yaml format.

## Generated content files

All files in `content/specification/` are automatically generated by the tool `grabrepos.py`.
A file for each tagged version of the Homie Core convention is generated. Only those sections
are considered that are mentioned in the `multiversion.yml` configuration file.

Preface documents, that are valid for all versions, are extracted from the `develop` branch and
prefaced on every document by the Hugo generator.
